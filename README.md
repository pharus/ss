My notes, laboratories, exercises et al on Signals in Systems(meaning the
Course at IST-UTL), even though you can use to study the subject on your own.

Repository structure:
- labs: the labs, both code, and solutions
- notes: notes and observations on the subject
- exercises: solved exercises from the book and others (The book I'll be using
 is Signals and Systems, by Allan V. Oppenheim)

Note: Reading [Think DSP](http://greenteapress.com/thinkdsp/thinkdsp.pdf) to
study Digital Signal Processing in Python.
